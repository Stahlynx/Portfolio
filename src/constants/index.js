As an undergraduate who is aiming to be a full stack developer, I have worked with a variety of technologies including HTML, CSS, React, Next.js,and Tailwind CSS. My journey in web development began with a deep curiosity for how things work, and it has evolved into a state where I continuously strive to learn and adapt to new challenges. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving complex problems to deliver high-quality solutions. Other than web developments, I've also worked with programming languages, such as C, C++, python, java, and javascript. Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active and exploring new technologies. To fill my boredom, I like to play games and watch shows`;
